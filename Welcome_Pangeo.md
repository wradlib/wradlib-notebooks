Welcome To Pangeo Binder
========================

This is a live session from which you can run scalable notebooks on the cloud.

A file browser listing example notebooks is available to the left.

Dask dashboard plots are available to the right.  
These will activate when you launch a Dask cluster and start doing work.
(these cells are already written for you).

To get started, double click on one of the notebooks to the left,
and start running through the Jupyter notebook cells.


Where is this running?

This session is running on [binder.pangeo.io](https://binder.pangeo.io),
a service designed and maintained by the [Pangeo community](https://pangeo.io) for scalable earth science.
It is running on Google Cloud Platform using credits generously donated by Google to that Community.
