    "Raw, unprocessed reflectivity products can already provide useful visual information about the spatial distribution of rainfall fields. However, in order to use weather radar observations for quantitative studies (e.g. in hydrological modelling or for assimilation into Numerical Weather Prediction models), the data has to be carefully processed in order to account for typical errors sources such as ground echoes (clutter), attenuation of the radar signal, or uncertainties in the Z/R relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it might be necessary to transfer the data from polar coordinates to cartesian grids, or to combine observations from different radar locations in overlapping areas on a common grid (composition). And in the end, you would typically like to visualise the spatial rainfall distribution on a map. Many users also need to quantify the potential error (uncertainty) of their data-based rainfall estimation.\n",

In the following, we will provide an outline of a typical processing chain, step-by-step. You might not need all steps for your own workflow, or you might need steps which are not yet included here."

    "Clutter are non-meteorological echos. They are caused by the radar beam hitting objects on the earth's surface (e.g. mountain or hill tops, houses, wind turbines) or in the air (e.g. airplanes, birds). These objects can potentially cause high reflectivities due large scattering cross sections. Static clutter, if not efficiently removed by Doppler filters, can cause permanent echos which could introduce severe bias in quantitative applications. Thus, an efficient identification and removal of clutter is mandatory e.g. for hydrological studies. Clutter removal can be based on static maps or dynamic filters. Normally, static clutter becomes visible more clearly in rainfall accumulation maps over periods of weeks or months. We recommend such accumulations to create static clutter maps which can in turn be used to remove the static clutter from an image and fill the resulting gaps by interpolation. "

    "Adjustment normally refers to using rain gage observations on the ground to correct for errors in the radar-based rainfall estimating. [Goudenhoofdt et al., 2009](https://docs.wradlib.org/en/latest/bibliography.html#goudenhoofdt2009) provide an excellent overview of adjustment procedures. A typical approach is to quantify the error of the radar-based rainfall estimate *at* the rain gage locations, assuming the rain gage observation to be accurate. The error can be assumed to be additive, multiplicative, or a mixture of both. Most approaches assume the error to be heterogeneous in space. Hence, the error at the rain gage locations will be interpolated to the radar bin (or grid) locations and then used to adjust (correct) the raw radar rainfall estimates.\n",
