    "[HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) is a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. The [OPERA program](https://www.eumetnet.eu/activities/observations-programme/current-activities/opera/) developed a convention (or information model) on how to store and exchange radar data in hdf5 format. It is based on the work of [COST Action 717](https://www.cost.eu/actions/717/) and is used e.g. in real-time operations in the Nordic European countries. The OPERA Data and Information Model (ODIM) is documented [here under OPERA Publications](https://www.eumetnet.eu/activities/observations-programme/current-activities/opera/). Make use of these documents in order to understand the organization of OPERA hdf5 files!\n",

That particular code was ported from $\\omega radlib$ to xradar. Please refer to xradar for enhancements for polar radar.    \n",

    "The hierarchical nature of HDF5 can be described as being similar to directories, files, and links on a hard-drive. Actual metadata are stored as so-called *attributes*, and these attributes are organized together in so-called *groups*. Binary data are stored as so-called *datasets*. As for ODIM_H5, the ``root`` (or top level) group contains three groups of metadata: these are called ``what`` (object, information model version, and date/time information), ``where`` (geographical information), and ``how`` (quality and optional/recommended metadata). For a very simple product, e.g. a CAPPI, the data is organized in a group called ``dataset1`` which contains another group called ``data1`` where the actual binary data are found in ``data``. In analogy with a file system on a hard-disk, the HDF5 file containing this simple product is organized like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    /\n",
    "    /what\n",
    "    /where\n",
    "    /how\n",
    "    /dataset1\n",
    "    /dataset1/data1\n",
    "    /dataset1/data1/data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The philosophy behind the $\\omega radlib$ interface to OPERA's data model is very straightforward: $\\omega radlib$ simply translates the complete file structure to *one* dictionary and returns this dictionary to the user. Thus, the potential complexity of the stored data is kept and it is left to the user how to proceed with this data. The keys of the output dictionary are strings that correspond to the \"directory trees\" shown above. Each key ending with ``/data`` points to a Dataset (i.e. a numpy array of data). Each key ending with ``/what``, ``/where`` or ``/how`` points to another dictionary of metadata. The entire output can be obtained by:"
